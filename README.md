# Convert .webp files to almost any picture format

This is a Python script that converts .webp files to almost any picture format. You can run the script in a Jupyter notebook and modify the input directory and output format to suit your needs.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, you will need:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org) installed on your computer.
2.  Required Python Libraries
    - Pillow - a Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork.
    - os - a module that provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
    To install these libraries, you can use the pip package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following commands:
    -To install Pillow:
     (```pip install Pillow) 
    -To install os:
        pip install os
    Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the script in a Jupyter notebook.
    If you encounter any issues during installation, try using a virtual environment or check the documentation for the library you are installing.






2. [Vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. Open VSCode.
2. Create a new Jupyter notebook file.
3. Copy and paste the code from this repository into the new Jupyter notebook file and run it.

## Usage

To use the script:

1. Modify the input directory and output format in the script.
2. Run the script in the Jupyter notebook.

The script will convert all .webp files in the input directory to the specified output format and save them in the output directory. The original .webp files will be moved to a new folder named "old".

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the script:

1. Ensure that Python and your text editor or IDE are installed.
2. Check that the input and output directories are correct.
3. Verify that you have the necessary permissions to read from and write to the directories.
4. Ensure that the file extension you specified is valid for the output format you want to use.
